            I'm Sakshat, a software engineer currently pursuing my MSSE at San Jos√© State University. Over the years, I've been working with cloud-native microservices, building fast APIs and scalable enterprise platforms. I focus on backend development, cloud infrastructure, and AI engineering.

            I love solving tough technical problems, whether that's making distributed systems faster, figuring out how to connect different software pieces, or building the structure for next-gen data services. When I'm not working, I'm usually playing with whatever new framework caught my eye, working on side projects with other developers, or out on local hiking trails.
